# 20-DOF Humanoid Robot Stabilization Using LIPM, MPC, and PD Control on Windows

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains an advanced implementation of a 20-Degree-of-Freedom (20-DOF) humanoid robot (Robotis OP3) simulation in MuJoCo on a Windows platform. It integrates the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) dynamics with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm over a 10-step prediction horizon, complemented by a Proportional-Derivative (PD) control layer. This significantly improves stable walking behavior and increases energy efficiency by approximately 20%.

## ü§ñ Robotis OP3 Overview

The Robotis OP3 is a sophisticated, research-grade humanoid robot designed with:

* **20 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: Enables complex joint movements required for realistic humanoid locomotion.
* **Dynamixel Actuators**: Offer precise torque and position control, crucial for advanced robotic applications.
* **Open-source architecture**: Provides flexibility for custom developments and easy integration with simulation environments such as MuJoCo.

## üìö Technical Concepts Explained

### Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM)

The LIPM is a simplified dynamic model widely utilized in humanoid robotics. It treats the robot's Center of Mass (CoM) as a single point mass, connected via a massless leg pivoting around the foot placement:

$$
\ddot{x}(t) = \frac{g}{z_0}(x(t) - p)
$$

**Variables Explained:**

* $x(t)$: CoM horizontal displacement.
* $g$: Gravity acceleration (\~9.81 m/s¬≤).
* $z_0$: Constant height of CoM.
* $p$: Foot pivot position.

The simplification allows efficient real-time computation.

### Model Predictive Control (MPC)

MPC is a sophisticated control technique employed to anticipate future system behaviors and optimize current control actions. MPC continuously solves an optimization problem:

$$
\min_{p_k} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} [(x_{k+1}-x_{ref,k+1})^T Q (x_{k+1}-x_{ref,k+1})+(p_k - p_{k-1})^T R (p_k - p_{k-1})]
$$

**Subject to:**

* Linearized LIPM dynamics.
* Step constraints (length, width).

### Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control

PD control complements MPC by regulating joint-level dynamics, providing fine-grained tracking accuracy and ensuring smooth joint movements:

$$
\tau = K_p(e) + K_d(\dot{e})
$$

* $\tau$: Joint torques.
* $K_p$: Proportional gain (reduces positional error).
* $K_d$: Derivative gain (dampens motion, reduces overshoot).
* $e$: Position error; $\dot{e}$: Velocity error.
